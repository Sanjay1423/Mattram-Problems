Build an Array With Stack Operations

Given an string targets separated with hyphen '-' with an integer n separated by '#'. In each iteration, you 
will read a number from string.

Build the string number values using the following operations:
Push: Read a new element from the beginning of the string number values, and push it in the array. Pop: delete the last element 
from the string. If the target value in the string is already built, stop reading more elements. Return the operations to build 
the target array. You are guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Input Format
The input format is string

Constraints
 <= target.length <= 100 1 <= target[i] <= n 1 <= n <= 100 target is strictly increasing.

Output Format
The output format is array

Sample Input 0
1-3#3

Sample Output 0
["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]

Explanation 0
Read number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1] Read number 2 and automatically push in the array 
then Pop it -> [1] Read number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]

Sample Input 1
1-2-3#3

Sample Output 1
["Push","Push","Push"]

Sample Input 2
1-2#4

Sample Output 2
["Push","Push"]

Explanation 2
Explanation: You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop

Sample Input 3
2-3-4#4

Sample Output 3
["Push","Pop","Push","Push","Push"]
